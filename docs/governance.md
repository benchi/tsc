# CSPA TSC Governance and Operating Guidelines

Note: this is a draft and living document.  We expect things to change over time to meet the needs of TSC and the broaded tech community.

For context, please see the [TSC overview](../README.md).

## Goal

The immediate goal of TSC is to release a new working version of the [CSPA Core Examâ„¢](https://cspa.io/about/exams) at the end of the three-month term.  This goal is subject to change, and can indeed be changed by majority vote of TSC.

## Term

We propose three-month terms, with optional renewals and no term limits.  Term structure can change -- we'll discuss and come to a consensus if the current structure is not working.

## Scope and Powers

The **Technical Steering Committee** has full authority over exam content and format.  The CSPA organization grants these powers to TSC.  The CSPA organization supports TSC in two key ways:

1. By advocating the resulting exam content as an industry standard through increased usage and recognition
2. By providing technical infrastructure and support for the administration and proctoring of such exams

## Voting (aka Decision-Making Procedures)

Voting seats are the **Industry**, **Education**, and **Open Source** seats.  Observers may participate in Slack discussions, but cannot vote. Observers include the CSPA moderator, other CSPA staff, and academic researchers.

Each voting seat has **one** vote.  Decisions will be made by **simple majority** on all matters.  For now, we'll be using the Slack bot [Polly](https://www.polly.ai/help/slack/quickstart-faq) to administer votes.

Any matter within the scope of TSC's responsibilities can be voted on.  Examples of matters subject to a vote are:

- Adding new classes of exams, or removing existing ones
- Changing the format (duration, quantity, and types of questions) of existing exams
- Submitting new feature requests (e.g. supporting new types of questions)
- Changing the [rules of exam conduct](https://cspa.io/conduct) and proctoring methods

## Other matters

Feedback and suggestions may be discussed in the Slack group, or by [contacting CSPA](https://cspa.io/contact).
